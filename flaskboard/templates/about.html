            Flask-Blogging is a Flask extension for adding Markdown based blog support 
            to your site. It provides a flexible mechanism to store the data in the database
            of your choice. It is meant to work with the authentication provided by packages 
            such as Flask-Login or Flask-Security.
            </p>
            <p style='background-color:rgb(252, 251, 250)'>
                The philosophy behind this extension is to provide a lean app based on Markdown 
            to provide blog support to your existing web application. If you already have a 
            web app and you need to have a blog to communicate with your user or to promote 
            your site through content based marketing, then Flask-Blogging would help you 
            quickly get a blog up and running.

                “Blog” is an abbreviated version of “weblog,” which is a term used to describe
                websites that maintain an ongoing chronicle of information. A blogger is a person 
                who owns or runs a blog or a person who maintains the blog. That is, posting 
                articles or new posts, information, sharing the most up-to-date news, opinions 
                and case studies to name but a few. Such entries are known as blog posts.

                Blogs range from the personal to the political, and can focus on one narrow subject 
            or a whole range of subjects. The application Blogger’s Stop provides a blueprint 
            as to how a blogging application works at a microscopic level. This application 
            comes up with a platform for bloggers to post blogs.
